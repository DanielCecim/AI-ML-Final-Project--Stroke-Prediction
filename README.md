# AI-ML-Final-Project--Stroke-Prediction
AI-Machine Learning Classification Project

This project develops a machine-learning model to support early detection of strokes using a tabular clinical
dataset. It contains relevant information for risk identification, including demographics, lifestyle, and
cardiovascular features. Because strokes remain one of the global leading causes of morbidity and mortality,
early screening carries important clinical value: detecting high-risk individuals. This enables timely interventions
that can reduce severe ramifications. This model also carries economic implications, as the prevention and
mitigation of strokes can lower long-term healthcare costs associated with hospitalisation, rehabilitation, and loss
of productivity. We evaluate regularised logistic regression models with Random Forest and XGBoost under
strong class imbalance and justify recall as the primary metric due to the high clinical cost of a false negative.
After the systematic comparison, a Ridge Logistic Regression model achieved the most reliable balance of recall,
discrimination, and interpretability, reaching a test-set recall of 0.82. Results support the hypothesis that age and
chronic cardiovascular conditions significantly increase stroke probability.
